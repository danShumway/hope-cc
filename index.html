           <h2 id="beliefs">BELIEFS</h2>

           <p>We are committed to a core set of beliefs that reflect the historic, orthodox beliefs of the Christian Church through the ages. These are the beliefs in which we have unity and on which we base our fundamental decisions.</p>

           <p><strong>God</strong> God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are Coequal and are one God.  Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19; 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Corinthians 13:14</p>

           <p><strong>Jesus Christ</strong>  Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit. Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven and will return again someday to earth to reign as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Matthew 1:22,23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5, 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14,15; 1 Corinthians 15:3,4;  Romans 1:3,4; Acts 1:9-11; 1 Timothy 6:14,15; Titus 2:13</p>

           <p><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong>  The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son of God. He is present in the world to make people aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians we seek to live under His control daily. 2 Corinthians 3:17; John 16:7-13, 14:16,17; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:12, 3:16; Ephesians 1:13, 5:18; Galatians 5:25</p>

           <p><strong>The Bible</strong>  The Bible is God's Word to all people. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is the truth without any mixture of error. <br>
           2 Timothy 3:16, 1:13; 2 Peter 1:20,21, Psalm 119:105, 160, 12:6; proverbs 30:5</p>

           <p><strong>Human Beings</strong>  People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. People are the supreme object of God's creation and love. Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called â€œsinâ€. This attitude separates people from God until the relationship is restored through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. <br>
           Genesis 1:17; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a, 59:1, 2; Romans 3:23</p>

           <p><strong>Salvation</strong>  Salvation is God's free gift from God to humanity. We can never make up for our sin by selfCimprovement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin's penalty. When we turn from our self ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith. Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8,9; John 14:6, 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1</p>

           <p><strong>Eternal Security</strong>  Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives us this security.  John 10:29, 30; 2 Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25, 10:10, 14; 1 Peter 1:3-5</p>

           <p><strong>Eternity</strong>  Humans were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or eternally in union with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are real places of eternal existence.  John 3:16; John 14:17; Romans 6:23, 8:17-18; Revelation 20:15; 1 Corinthians 2:7-9</p>

           <h3 id="what-helping-people-become-fully-devoted-followers-of-jesus-christ">What?   Helping people become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.</h3>

           <p>Because Jesus came to seek and save the lost, we feel compelled to do the same. But Jesus went beyond rescuing people from hell; He wanted to make them fit for heaven. Through the various sub-ministries of the church, we desire people not only to meet Christ but also over time, to grow in their faith so that they live obediently to His commands and become conformed to His character. </p>

           <h2 id="our-purpose-what-were-doing">Our Purpose - What we're doing</h2>

           <p>We use five purposes to describe God's design for the church. To the extent that we engage in these activities, we fulfill God's purposes in our midst.   We Worship God, Belong in His family, Grow spiritually, Share our faith, and Serve God and others.</p>
